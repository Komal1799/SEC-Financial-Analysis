# # AI Tools Used:
Perplexity: We used this tool to quickly understand concepts related to Airflow, DAGs, and data storage strategies. Perplexity helped clarify the basics of scheduling workflows, defining DAGs, and managing dependencies in the Airflow pipeline.

ChatGPT: We used ChatGPT to deepen our understanding of Snowflake data storage, transforming data from S3 to Snowflake, and writing Airflow DAG files for triggering pipelines. ChatGPT provided guidance on how to properly implement the data pipeline, as well as best practices for managing and structuring the DAGs.

These tools were essential in helping us structure the data workflow, enabling the creation of Airflow DAGs, and ensuring proper data transformation and storage in Snowflake. They were primarily used for learning, reference, and writing the necessary scripts to ensure the pipeline's successful execution.
